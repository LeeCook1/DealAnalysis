# DealAnalysis
This will assist with deal analysis and automation. Automation has to happen in 3 different phases:

1. Address Population
2. Data Retrieval
3. Data Analysis

### Phase 1: Address Population
This phase is all about how to get the addresses to analyze. 

### Phase 2: Data Retrieval
This phase is responsible for retrieving the data necessary for the specific addresses.

### Phase 3: Data Analysis
nce the data is retrieved, analysis is next to determine whether the address meets a certain criteria.
